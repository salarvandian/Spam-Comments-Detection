# Spam Comments Detection with Machine Learning
Detecting spam comments means classifying them as either spam or not spam. One of the most popular platforms that uses machine learning to automatically filter spam comments is YouTube, which helps content creators avoid annoying and irrelevant comments.

If you want to learn how to detect spam comments using machine learning, this project is for you!

In this project, I will guide you step by step through the process of building a spam comment detection system using Python and machine learning techniques. By working with real-world data and widely used tools, you will learn how to create and evaluate models that can effectively identify spam comments.

ðŸ“Œ Project Features:

Text processing and data preprocessing
Implementing machine learning models
Evaluating model performance and optimization
This hands-on project will help you understand how modern spam filters work and improve your machine learning skills. ðŸ˜Ž
